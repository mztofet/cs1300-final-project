# cs1300-final-project


We decided to go with the prompt of Stellar Explorations for inspiration:

"You have been hired by a fictitious client, Stellar Explorations Inc., a company dedicated to promoting space education and awareness. They would like you to build a website that showcases NASA's publicly available data in an engaging and informative way. Your task is to create a website that fetches data from NASA's API and displays it on the website with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. This project should NOT be a Single Page Application (SPA).


Requirements
API Key:
This API requires the generation of an API key. An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate requests associated with your project.
Create your API key by signing up for one at the top of the NASA API page. Fill out the required information and you should receive your API key in your email inbox.
Do not share your API key with anyone.
Home Page:
This page should have an overview of Stellar Explorations Inc. and the purpose of the website.
A navigation menu linking to the different pages of the website.
APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) Page:
Fetch and display the current Astronomy Picture of the Day from the NASA API.
You will occasionally receive a video as the URL of the APOD for a given day.
Ensure you are sending the appropriate parameter along with the API request to retrieve the thumbnails in the event that this occurs.
Include the picture, title, explanation, and date.
Add search functionality to view the APOD for any specific date.
A navigation menu linking to the different pages of the website.
Mars Rover Photos Page:
Display recent photos taken by the Mars Curiosity Rover in reverse order.
A navigation menu linking to the different pages of the website.
NASA Earth Observation Data Page:
Show satellite images of Earth based on user-specified coordinates (latitude and longitude).
Include an input form for users to enter the coordinates and date to fetch the corresponding satellite images.
A navigation menu linking to the different pages of the website.
User Experience and Design:
The website should be responsive and work well on desktop and mobile devices.
Use a modern, clean design aesthetic that fits the space exploration theme.
(Optional) Wireframe:
It is highly recommended that you create a set of wireframes for each page.
We recommend you use the drawio.com website to create your wireframe, but it can also be done by hand with a notebook.
Watch this video for more information on creating wireframes using drawio.com.
Stretch Goals
Add one more page to the website called:

Interactive Space Weather Dashboard:
This page should display real-time data about space weather (solar flares, geomagnetic storms, etc.).
It should use graphs and charts to make the data more understandable. For more information on graphing solutions, look into the ChartJS charting library."
